## **AI-YURVEDA: Personalized Nutrition with Ayurveda & AI**  

### **Overview**  
DIETEL by QAFILA is an AI-powered personalized nutrition assistant that integrates Ayurvedic principles with modern technology to provide customized diet plans. Our platform considers users' Dosha types, health conditions, and lifestyle habits to recommend meal plans, suggest Ayurvedic products, and offer real-time dietary guidance via a chatbot.  

Now, we are introducing **food image analysis**, allowing users to upload meal images. Our AI model will estimate the calorie content and adjust users’ calorie goals dynamically to align with their dietary needs.
